      <div class="line">Hello, <span class="varName"></span>. I take it that you are here to ask me questions concerning the Big Bang? </div>
      <div class="line">Who are you? I wasn't told who I'd be meeting with.</div>
      <div class="line">Well, <span class="varName"></span>, I am the physicist who, both before death and after death, has only been able to communicate through text on a screen with a rather iconic robotic voice.</div>
      <div class="line">...Stephen Hawking?</div>
      <div class="line">Perhaps.</div>
      <div class="line">Okay... Anyway, I have studied what the Big Bang Theory suggests. I know that even time and space were once within an initial singularity of immense heat and infinite density. Then it underwent 'cosmic inflation' where the universe expanded faster than light. After the collision of subatomic particles, there was light. And after gravity slowed expansion, dark energy now continues to repel matter from matter everywhere at an ever-accelerating rate. But I sense there is more to the whole theory.</div>
      <div class="line">As an oversimplification, you are right. And of course, underneath all the information you are taught, there are reasons. Sometimes speculative. Sometimes conflicting. Nevertheless, this is our best and grandest theory.</div>
      <div class="line">But I guess questions come up when I suddenly realized that all the videos and pictures we see about it are simply close artistic models, not a camera recording, though it sometimes appears just as realistic."</div>
      <div class="line">The only 'real' and the most precise 'visual representation' of what happened billions of years ago lies on paper scribbled with mathematics and physics.</div>
      <div class="line">So how do we know our conceptual understanding of the initial conditions is true? The figures with which we calculate might no longer be accurate when regarding the distant past.</div>
      <div class="line">Ah, fascinating question. Well, cosmologists follow this general schema: we perform calculations on all the lasting effects of the Big Bang which we can observe until today. We can then "rewind" the universe back in time by noting the acceleration of expansion and entropy!</div>
      <div class="line">That makes sense.</div>
      <div class="line">You will also recall that this methodology is applied to what we call 'evidence' like the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, the Doppler redshift, and the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem.</div>
      <div class="line">Since our equations can turn back time for us, why stop at the singularity? What was before it?</div>
      <div class="line">Ah, so the greatest misconception about it remains popularized today. <span class="varName"></span>, the Big Bang Theory does not describe the 'Origin of the Universe' but instead merely its exponential growth and history. It is not an explosion IN space but an expansion OF space. Because spacetime exists only after the singularity, our math and physics break down towards the absolute beginning. I will admit, physicists have no certainty about anything prior.</div>
      <div class="line">But surely there are some theories?</div>
      <div class="line">Quite right. Some say our universe 'bounced' into existence from a previous universe that collapsed. Others employ the multiverse. But most think that the unstable quantum fluctuations of virtual particles is what 'sparked the singularity'.</div>

    <div class="lineSection">
      <div class="line">Anything else you would like to ask?</div>
      <div class="line">I wonder, has there ever been controversy in the evidence behind the Big Bang?</div>
      <div class="line">Yes. I recall doing my doctoral thesis in a time when physicists were still split between a universe with a singularity and an eternal 'steady-state' universe. An interesting fact is that the greatest opposition to the Big Bang was Albert Einstein himself!</div>
      <div class="line">Wait, didn't Einstein develop General Relativity, which is a strong evidence for an expanding universe?</div>
      <div class="line">Also true. You see, Einstein did not like the idea of a universe with a beginning. So he introduced a little "fudge factor" into his calculations. It is now called the Cosmological Constant and is a force countering gravity, thereby making the universe static again.</div>
      <div class="line">But a force the counters gravity sounds a lot like dark energy.</div>
      <div class="line">Spot on! Einstein was mistaken to inject something so ad hoc, and yet was mistaken again to take it out! His constant was mathematically identical to dark energy which would be discovered many years later.</div>
      <div class="line">Interesting, I'd never heard of that before. Anyways, I'm also curious about the wide gap between the expansion of the universe and the galaxies and stars we have now. Was earth once shrunk as a speck inside the singularity then grew bigger?</div>
      <div class="line">No, not even close, <span class="varName"></span>. Helium together with hydrogen clumps into clouds of gas, where gravity pulls in surrounding matter to form stars and galaxies. Now, stars begin to explode as supernovas, and from this, a particular cloud collapses into a spinning disk. It draws so much energy that it becomes our Sun.</div>
      <div class="line">And since the Sun has its own gravitational center, it then attracts surrounding matter as well?</div>
      <div class="line">Exactly. Then emerges planets, moons, and asteroid belts.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="lineSection">
      <div class="line">You are almost out of time with me. I have a chess rematch with Paul Rudd soon.</div>
      <div class="line">Hm. I regret to ask this, but to put it bluntly: what is all this for? It bothers me that I cannot think of any practical use for the decades of research on the Big Bang.</div>
      <div class="line">Well, the simplest answer to that is: we do not know yet! Most scientific discoveries are found whose most powerful uses would only be made known decades later, even after the scientist has died. We can neither say for sure that cosmology and our theories will be useful, nor can we say it is useless.</div>
      <div class="line">So we use General Relativity for GPS tracking and for synchronizing clocks around the world?</div>
      <div class="line">Precisely, and even for satellites and space explorations. There's also gravitational lensing for galaxy imaging. Furthermore, if I may be bleak, measuring the rate of expansion allows us to predict the fate of the universe.</div>
      <div class="line">Could it also indirectly applicable through research in other fields of science?</div>
      <div class="line">Most definitely. In my own life, I have worked on interpolating the Big Bang with black holes, the nature of time, and quantum mechanics. It might even lead to a Theory of Everything. Besides that, physicists who invent particle accelerators to imitate the collisions of subatomic particles will help our understanding of present-day matter.</div>
      <div class="line">I think now I see how it's important. But the Big Bang still feels somehow distant. Many billion years distant from me today.</div>
      <div class="line">I do not know if I agree with it, but my wife Jane used to remind me that not every quest must have solely physical significance for the search to be worthwhile. Cosmology will always be in a broader discussion with theology and philosophy. Insofar as we are humans, the formation of the universe will always be a subject in which the world's most curious and sharpest minds shall gather... <br><br>[END]</div>
